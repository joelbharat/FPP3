1.   Write a function to compute the mean and standard deviation of a time series, and apply it to the PBS data. Plot the series with the highest mean, and the series with the lowest standard deviation.

Ans.   
```{r}
PBS %>%
  features(Cost, list(mean = mean)) %>%
  arrange(mean) -> mean_data
tail(mean_data,1)->val
PBS %>% filter(Concession=="Concessional",Type==as.character(val[1,2]), ATC1==as.character(val[1,3]), ATC2==as.character(val[1,4])) %>% autoplot(Cost)
```

```{r}
PBS %>%
  features(Cost, list(sd = sd)) %>%
  arrange(sd) -> sd_data
head(sd_data,1)->val
PBS %>% filter(Concession=="Concessional",Type==as.character(val[1,2]), ATC1==as.character(val[1,3]), ATC2==as.character(val[1,4])) %>% autoplot(Cost)
```

2.  Use GGally::ggpairs() to look at the relationships between the STL-based features for the holiday series in the tourism data. Change seasonal_peak_year and seasonal_trough_year to factors, as shown in Figure 4.3. Which is the peak quarter for holidays in each state?

```{r}
#library(glue)

tourism %>%
  features(Trips, list(sd = sd)) %>%
  arrange(sd)

tourism_features <- tourism %>%
  features(Trips, feature_set(pkgs = "feasts"))

tourism_features %>%
  select_at(vars(contains("season"), Purpose)) %>%
  mutate(
    seasonal_peak_year = seasonal_peak_year +
      4*(seasonal_peak_year==0),
    seasonal_trough_year = seasonal_trough_year +
      4*(seasonal_trough_year==0),
    seasonal_peak_year = glue("Q{seasonal_peak_year}"),
    seasonal_trough_year = glue("Q{seasonal_trough_year}"),
  ) %>%
  GGally::ggpairs(mapping = aes(colour = Purpose))
```



3.   Use a feature-based approach to look for outlying series in the PBS data. What is unusual about the series you identify as “outliers.”

Ans.  
```{r}
tourism %>% features(Trips, feature_set(pkgs = "feasts"))
```



```{r}
PBS %>%
  features(Cost, list(sd = sd)) %>%
  arrange(sd)
```

```{r}
tourism %>%
  features(Trips, list(sd = sd)) %>%
  arrange(sd)
```
